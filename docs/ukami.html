			<h2>Ukami&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>_TRAILER_</em></h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The clan Mononobe and Ukami have been fighting for years, but to no avail.
				In recent events, the Ukami warlord got slaughtered in a fight and the Mononobe clan
				managed to steal their sacred legacy, a jewel which contained so much power, that could
				bring upon their hands a complete control over the existing territories at that time.
				After their father's death, Hayate and Nozomu became the new high warlords of the Ukami clan.
				<br>
				<br>Ukami is a 2D rogue-like based game where Hayate and Nozomu have to recover their clan's sacred legacy
				and revenge their father's death. Will the clan Mononobe be able to resist the brothers swift rage?
				<br>
				<br>This trailer was made with Adobe After Effects and Photoshop.
