			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>Dodgeball Masters is a frenetic game where two teams will compete
				<br>until one stands above the other by process of elimination.
				<br>There are 8 different characters, where each one of them has its own strengths and weaknessess.
				<br>It's a 3v3 gameplay, where the process of elimination is the only way
				<br>to achieve victory.
