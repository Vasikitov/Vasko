			<h2>Ukami&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>_GAME_</em></h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The clan Mononobe and Ukami have been fighting for years, but to no avail.
				<br>In recent events, the Ukami warlord got slaughtered in a fight and the Mononobe clan
				<br>managed to steal their sacred legacy, a jewel which contained so much power, that could
				<br>bring upon their hands a complete control over the existing territories at that time.
				<br>After their father's death, Hayate and Nozomu became the new high warlords of the Ukami clan.
				<br>
				<br>Ukami is a 2D rogue-like based game where Hayate and Nozomu have to recover their clan's sacred legacy
				<br>and revenge their father's death. Will the clan Mononobe be able to resist the brothers swift rage?
				<br>
				<br>This game was a group project and was made from scratch using C++, SFML library and Box2D for the physics.
