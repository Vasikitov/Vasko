			<h2>Realistic Korean Female Character [Sci-Fi]</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				This is my most ambitious project so far. It was one of the projects that I made during my master degree
				at Voxel School in Spain. We had to make a realistic character and I decided to make a female character related
				to the Sci-Fi world.
				<br>
				<br>
				The model and armor were sculpted in Zbrush. I used Substance Painter for the texturing of the armor and Photoshop/Zbrush Polypaint for
				the texturing of the skin and eyes. For the hair I used Xgen and for the final composition and lighting, Maya.
