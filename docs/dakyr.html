			<h2>Dakyr the Bloodseeker</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				3D sculpt of the main enemy inside my game, Yethanima, which is still under
				development. For this one, I wanted to achieve a monster, which incites dread
				all around the place.
				<br>
				<br>The sculpt was made inside Zbrush and there is also an in-game version of the
				monster with all the UV's for the textures and also the normal map, which will
				be useful to preserve all the details, since I had to drastically reduce
				the polygons to make the model game ready and easy for animations.
