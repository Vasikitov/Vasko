			<h2>U.F.O Driver</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>56.890 light years into outer space...
				<br>You start off as Michael Collins, an astronaut trying to
				find the missing starships, which are scattered all over
				the universe.
				<br>
				<br>These contain resources which belong to a specific planet
				fulfilled with living beings of a kind. They are in need of
				these resources in order to survive and keep evolving.
				<br>
				<br>Be careful though, there are some evil beings and obstacles
				throughout the map which will be deadly if you can't manage
				to surpass.
				<br>
				<br>Are you able to recover the starships and gain the trust
				of each faction?
				<br>
				<br>I'm sure you are... or maybe... not.
				<br>
				<br>The game was made from scratch using Z80 Assembly language and CPCTelera.
