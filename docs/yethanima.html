			<h2>Yethanima&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>_GAME_</em></h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				Yethanima is my final degree project at my University. The project consists of creating a
				3D game inside Unreal Engine with the additional usage of tools such as Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter, FL Studio and Photoshop.
				<br>
				<br>
				The game is insipired from "The Maze Runner", a film that is all about escaping from a maze that you know very little about.
				Huge mysteries remain uncovered and the player has to find a way to escape the maze. Additional gameplay features have been developed
				to make the game even more interesting such as the different challenges inside Yethanima which are needed in order to progress throughout
				the game.
				<br>

				<b>Released:</b> 2021
