			<h2>Chinese Low-Poly Stylized Environment</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				This is a small stylized environment I made during the Spanish Game Jam in September 2020. The game concept was "duel"
				so the first thing that came to mind was a chinese environment, with its typical buildings, where two samurais will fight
				each other until one remains victorious.
				<br>
				<br>All these assets were made inside Blender and the texturizing was made within Substance Painter.

				<b>Released:</b> 2020
